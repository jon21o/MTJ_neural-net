# MTJ-Neural-Net

**This code is intended for demonstration purposes only. It is a simple demonstration of how python can be used to control source-measure units and switchmatrices to electrically test nanoscale devices (magnetic tunnel junctions), store the data in an n-dimensional Xarray DataArray, and analyze and plot the results in a Jupyter notebook using Bokeh.**
